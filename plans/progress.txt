2026-01-12: PRD created from GitHub issues
- Pulled 4 open issues from GitHub (#21, #22, #23, #24)
- Excluded #22 (docs task) per user request - blocked on external action
- Created 4 features from remaining 3 issues:
  * notify-001 (P1): Reduce Discord notification noise - GitHub #23
  * change-001 (P1): Add change detection to skip unchanged sheets - GitHub #21
  * name-001 (P2): Support First/Last Name columns - GitHub #24
  * name-002 (P2): Handle name parsing edge cases - GitHub #24

notify-001 COMPLETE
Summary: Added conditional notification logic - skip Discord notifications when added=0 AND errors=0
Files: src/scheduler/cron.ts, src/scheduler/cron.test.ts
Gotchas: None - straightforward change to notifySuccess helper

change-001 COMPLETE
Summary: Added in-memory hash-based change detection to skip sync when sheet data is unchanged
Files: src/sync/sync.ts, src/sync/sync.test.ts
Gotchas: Used node:crypto instead of Bun.CryptoHasher since vitest runs in Node.js context

name-001 COMPLETE
Summary: Added COLUMN_FIRST_NAME and COLUMN_LAST_NAME env vars with combineName utility
Files: src/config.ts, src/google/client.ts, src/google/client.test.ts, src/sync/sync.ts, src/test/config.ts
Gotchas: Needed to update ColumnIndices interface and test helpers for new structure

name-002 COMPLETE
Summary: Edge cases handled in combineName function (whitespace, empty names)
Notes: Implemented as part of name-001 - combineName handles all edge cases
