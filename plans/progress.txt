--- Session History ---

[INIT-001] COMPLETE
Summary: Initialized Bun + TypeScript + Effect project with package.json, tsconfig.json, biome.json, and basic main.ts entry point
Files: package.json, tsconfig.json, biome.json, src/main.ts
Gotchas: Effect.gen had type issues with TypeScript - simplified to Effect.sync for initial working version

[STRUCT-001] COMPLETE
Summary: Created project directory structure with all module directories (google, groupme, state, scheduler, error, core, types) and barrel exports
Files: src/google/*, src/groupme/*, src/state/*, src/scheduler/*, src/error/*, src/core/*, src/types/*, src/index.ts
Gotchas: Had naming conflicts between interface and const objects - renamed interfaces/types to avoid merge conflicts (e.g., GroupMeApi → GroupMeApiAddMember)

[BIOME-001] COMPLETE
Summary: Configured Biome formatter and linter with biome.json, added format/check scripts to package.json
Files: biome.json, package.json (scripts), tsconfig.json (Effect plugin)
Gotchas: biome.json indentStyle value was "spaces" but Biome expects "space" (singular)
